                The 1970s: The earliest computer games were developed in the 1970s and
                they were text-based adventures and simple games. Even though it was
                not played on devices we would recognise as personal computers, gaming
                may never have evolved in the same way if Allan Alcorn had not created
                <em>Pong</em> in 1972, a super popular tennis-style game involved two
                players using sliding paddles in a battle to score 11 points and was
                instrumental in the success of Atari and the advent of at-home gaming
                in the years to come.

                The 2000s: The first few decades of the 2000s have seen spectacular
                developments in the consumer PC hardware market, with Intel, AMD, and
                Nvidia rapidly increasing the processing and graphical power of
                personal computers to accompany high-resolution flat-screen monitors.
                Gaming PCs built with the components and physical traits that are
                designed to separate themselves from other computers have become
                increasingly popular. Steam, first released in 2003, has exploded in
                popularity as a centralized library and marketplace of PC games with
                over 50,000 titles, including vintage games highlighting the best
                titles in the history of PC games. The future of PC gaming has never
                been brighter, with virtual reality and other innovations making a new
                level of immersion possible. Popular games during this time included
                <em>Half-Life 2</em> <em>Warcraft</em>, and
                <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>, which cement the history of PC
                games.
