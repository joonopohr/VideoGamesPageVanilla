            <h1>Quick history of Playstation</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Playstation 1 (PS1): It was among the first wave of consoles capable
                of delivering 3D visuals, while also being arguebly the first CD-based
                console to realy gain a widespread, global phenomenon. CDs had much
                slower loading timesthan cartridges but offered 700MB of data compared
                to the maximum storage of 64GB seen in many N64 games. This allows PS1
                developers to cran tons of in-game content , plenty of hours of audio
                tracking/voice acting, and loads of video gaame content into their
                games.

                </figure>

                <li>
                Playstation 2 (PS2): Released in 2000, Sony embraced the multimedia
                experience by offering support to DVDs. Emotion Engine CPU CPU and
                Graphics Synthesizer CPU required plenty of finese on the parts of
                developers. Studios in the 2000s were able to deliver gorgeous games
                like God Of War titles, Metal Gear Solid 2, Devil May Cry 3 and
                more.....
                </li>

                <li>
                Playstation 3 (PS3): The PS3 was filled to the brim with exotic and/or
                cutting-edge tech at launch, such as a purpose-built Cell processor,
                NVIDIA RSX GPU, and a Blu-Ray drive. And this was Sony’s first console
                designed with HD from the get-go, supporting an HDMI output and 1080p
                resolution. The company even offered support for PS2 games by
                including the PS2’s hardware in the new console. Unfortunately for
                Sony, the first year and a bit of release was a disappointment due to
                both the price and the somewhat barren game library. This period even
                saw the spawning of the “PS3 has no games” meme, owing to the drought
                of titles in the early going.

                <li>
                Playstation 4 (PS4): It seemed like Sony learned its lesson with the
                PS3, as 2013’s PS4 launched at a solid $399 price tag and opted for
                largely conventional hardware. The PS4 offered an AMD APU, featuring
                an octa-core Jaguar-based CPU, custom AMD graphics, and 8GB of GDDR5
                RAM. This architecture made the PS4 a very developer-friendly console,
                allowing studios to hit the ground running and deliver some great
                titles from the get-go. These games included exclusives like Uncharted
                4: A Thief’s End, Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, Marvel’s Spider-Man,
                and Ghost of Tsushima. The vast majority of multi-platform games also
                ran better on the PS4 compared to the Xbox One.

                <li>
                Playstation 5 (PS5): Sony’s latest console is 2020’s PlayStation 5,
                and it represented another major step forward in terms of technology.
                The Achilles heel of the PS4 was the CPU, which was actually built
                with low-end tablets and netbooks in mind. But Sony upgraded things in
                a big way with the PS5, using an octa-core AMD Zen 2 CPU paired with
                RDNA2 graphics and 16GB of GDDR6 RAM. Perhaps the biggest upgrade
                comes in the storage arena, as the PS5 adopts a super-fast custom NVMe
                M.2 SSD (825GB). This enables lightning-fast loading times in games,
                even in open-world titles. Sony has also focused on audio with the new
                console, with its so-called Tempest Engine tech enabling more
                immersive audio effects when used with headphones.
