                Xbox: Released in November 2001, it was Microsoft's first foray into
                the console market.The console’s prototype was put together at first
                as a side project, using Dell laptop parts and then Microsoft decided
                to redesign it. This led Xbox to use the PC’s x86 architecture, a
                build that was very rare for a console at the time. Microsoft
                engineers originally called the console “DirectX Box“, named after the
                DirectX graphics technology, that was developed for PC gaming and
                later was shortened to Xbox. Xbox was the first console to have a
                built-in Ethernet port, combined with a broadband connection. It was
                the time were Xbox Live launched and Microsoft offered to players a
                unique, steady and reliable online experience, but only with a
                subscription. One of the biggest hits for Xbox was <strong>Halo</strong>, a
                science fiction first-person shooter game, developed by Bungie, with
                smooth and balanced gameplay followed with its sequel in 2004 were
                more-than-enough reasons to buy an Xbox. Many Many other exclusive
                titles followed like <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> and
                <em>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</em>, which helped a lot
                the franchise to succeed.

                Xbox 360: Released in November 2005, the Xbox 360 is a home video game
                console developed by Microsoft. As the successor to the original Xbox,
                it is the second console in the Xbox series. The Xbox 360 features an
                online service, Xbox Live, which was expanded from its previous
                iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the
                console’s lifetime. Available in free and subscription-based
                varieties, Xbox Live allows users to: play games online; download
                games (through Xbox Live Arcade) and game demos; purchase and stream
                music, television programs, and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox
                Video portals; and access third-party content services through media
                streaming applications. In addition to online multimedia features, the
                Xbox 360 allows users to stream media from local PCs. Several
                peripherals have been released, including wireless controllers,
                expanded hard drive storage, and the Kinect motion sensing camera. The
                release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox
                brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it
                into a hub for living-room computing entertainment.

                Xbox One: The Xbox One was released in November 2013 and Microsoft's
                first conosole to promote an entertainment system, rather than a
                gaming hub. At launch it included a number of video streaming
                services, and there was the ability to route your cable box through
                the console to be able to use it to watch live TV, even while you’re
                playing games. It featured improved hardware, including an eight-core
                processor and 8GB of RAM, and online gaming capabilities through Xbox
                Live.

                hardware, including a custom SSD for faster load times, ray tracing
                capabilities, and backward compatibility with many Xbox 360 games and
                Xbox One games.
