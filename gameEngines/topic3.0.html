            <h2>What is a game engine?</h2>
            <p> Game engines is a software that provides a generic framework for games to be developed upon using prebuilt components.</p>

            <h2>What can game engines do?</h2>
            <p> Game engines helps simplifying the game development process byallowing the developer to gain access to multiple components thatwould otherwise take time to create. Game Engines can manage things such as rendering, audio inputs and outputs or memory management which reduces the overall work that the developer has to do. </p>

            <h2>Where are game engines used?</h2>
            <p> Game engines are used by a variety of companies and peoples. It is mainly used by companies / people in the game developing industry to develop games and is also utilsed within the entertainment industry tocreate enviroments for the actors to work with while they are acting. </p>

            <h2>Why are game engines used in game development?</h2>
            <p> Due to the increasing demand for resources in developing games, gamedevelopers and business stakeholders &#39;can no longer rely on recouping their entire investment from a single game&#39; (M. Lewis,J. Jacobson). Because of this, game developers turn to game engines to set the basic framework for the games that they are going to develop. Doing this helps to save costs in developing the game and time by reducing the amount of time needed to develop the basic groundwork for the game. </p>
