                    <h2>How did game engines grow so prevalent?</h2>
                    <p> Game engines grew prevalent over the years due to the increasingimporvements towards computers which leads to games being more demanding as more resources are needed to create a proper game compared to creating a game in the 2000s. </p>
                    <p> With the increase in more resources required, it is not suitable to spend a lot of money on things such as input or audio management as they are mainly the same for most games. Due to this, game engines have become prevalent as developers don't need to contribute resources into creating things from the scratch. </p>

                    <h2>What is the potenial future of game engines?</h2>
                    <article>
                        <h3>Future in the training</h3>
                        <p> With the game engines' ability to create realistic situations, it is quite possible to see the increase in training games that parallel real life situations such as emergency response or for training in space.</p>
                        <p> This is already seen through simulations such as Unreal Triage that adopts the game Unreal Tournmanent into a emergency response game and in NASA where they are utlising Unreal Engine 5 to create a Mars simulation with the use of augmented reality. </p>

                    <article>
                        <h3>Future in the game industry.</h3>
                        <p> Based on the trend of game engines being more and more accessiable for consumers, we could see the increase in games being made and published as information in how to use game engines are more avaliable. </p>
                        <p> We could also see the increase in scale for games as computers and game engines have gained more power allowing game developers to afford to spend more money on expanding the scale of the game. </p>
