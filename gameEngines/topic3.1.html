                    <h2>What are some of the features in game engines?</h2>
                    <p> Game engines includes many things such as a rendering engine, resource libaries and managers for scenes, memory, inputs, audio. During this section, we will further look into what each feature cando in creating a game.</p>

                        <dt>Scene Manger</dt>
                        <dd> This manages the objects<sup>2</sup> and resources within a scene<sup>1</sup> and makes sure that they are placed in the correct postion.</dd>

                        <dt>Rendering Engine</dt>
                        <dd> It is an engine that helps with the process of creating a 2D / 3D scene<sup>1</sup> for the player to see through the use of a file that store multiple details such as where the object is placed, where the lighting is from and the height and width of the scene<sup>1</sup>. </dd>

                        <dt>Resource libraries</dt>
                        <dd> A list of assets<sup>4</sup> that are intergrated within the game engine. </dd>
                        <dd>Inside the libary, there are many things such as an objects<sup>2</sup> ranging from a chair to book or a pre-built menu screen.</dd>

                        <dt>Scripting</dt>
                        <dd> A feature that allows the developer to add their own code to do things that the game engine can't do by itself. </dd>
                        <dd> Scripting for example can allow the player to interact with an object.</dd>

                        <dt>Memory Manager</dt>
                        <dd> Memory Manager is used to allocate memory to functions that will be used within the game and can also unallocate once the functionis no longer needed. </dd>
                        <dd> This is useful as having every function run at the same time would overwhelm the computer.</dd>

                        <dt>Input Manager</dt>
                        <dd> The input management deals with what happens when a player puts an input<sup>3</sup> into the game. </dd>
                        <dd> What the input management does is receive input<sup>3</sup>s from either keyboards, mouses, or joysticks, and with that information, the game is told about the received input<sup>3</sup> and then the game does whatever is required when a player presses an input<sup>3</sup>. </dd>

                        <dt>Audio Manager</dt>
                        <dd> This feature helps with determining when audio outputs are being used within the game. </dd>
