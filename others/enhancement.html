                    <article> 
                        <h3> What is it? </h3>
                        <p> The flexbox is a CSS layout that is used to seperate sections of a page into flexible boxes that can respond to what the user is doing.  </p>

                        <p> This goes beyond the basic requirements of assignment by making the website more responsive and flexible towards the users need. </p>
                    </article>

                    <article>
                        <h3> What is needed to implement this feature? </h3>
                        <p> For the flexbox to be utilised, the section that you want to give the flex property will need to have the CSS property, "display: flex". After this, find two elements and give them the "flex: 1" property. With this, the elements will flex their widths within the section to respond to the user changing the size of the window. </p>
                    </article>

                    <article>
                        <h3> How is it used? </h3>
                        <p> This is applied within the text section of most pages as the header and footer stay the same size, but the text section flexs its heights to adjust to the website height or the moniter size. The flexbox is also utilised within this page with the enchancement boxes as they are using flex to maintain its width when the window size changes etc. </p>

                    <article> 
                        <h3> What is it? </h3>
                        <p> Pseudo Classes are CSS properties that select an element and can do a variety of things such as changing colour when hovering or changing a colour when a wrong input is given. There are many psuedo classes such as hover, invalid, or nth-child()</p>

                        <p> It goes beyond the basic requirements by making responsive to the user's input. This helps the website to feel more alive and makes the website less static. </p>

                        <p> The devleoper needs an html element and CSS to implement this feature. Within the css, the user needs to select an element and give it a psuedo class such as p:hover. When the developer gives a declaration such as a text color of red, the text will change to the color red when the user hovers over the p element. </p>
