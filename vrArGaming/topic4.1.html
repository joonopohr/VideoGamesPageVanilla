        <h1> Virtual Reality </h1>
        <p>VirVirtual Reality systems are now mostly powered by personal computers and desktops, as modern technology allows the system to render in games using today’s powerful graphics cards. PC’s have become sophisticated enough to run the tools that support the software that creates virtual environments, which are viewed using a virtual reality headset. Virtual reality games have the environment created on software such as the graphics engine Unreal Engine 5. These game engines are used to build 3D models of the environment. This model will include properties such as the geometry of the room, surface properties, and more. (Learn more about game engines here.) As the years go on, different types of screens were experimented to try and create the illusion of a virtual reality. Most HMDs (head mounted devices) now use LCD (liquid crystal display) instead of the CRT (cathode ray tube). Each type of display has it’s own advantages and disadvantages, but modern LCDs have much improved and use higher resolution and better color saturation. Headsets like the Oculus Quest 2 (developed by Oculus, Facebook Technologies,) can support up to 120hz, giving the user a much smoother experience, further enhancing the virtual reality experience.    </p>

        <h1> Augmented reality </h1>
        <p> Alternate reality games are creative games, and can vary a lot, as games like I love bees (2004) was more of a story with clues as the community would try to figure out the puzzle. This game would be played across the United States, sometimes requiring players to physically go to certain places at the right time to figure out a clue. Another way of playing ARGs are the games played on a device, yet uses the real life surroundings of the player. These games however are often called augmented reality games, or mixed reality games. For example, the game Pokémon Go had the player go to locations to locate a Pokémon (a fictional creature), and view it on the mobile phone, and try to ‘catch’ it. Games like these can be dangerous as the games would have the players go around their area looking on their phones, which can lead players onto roads or worse. </p>

        <h1> Spatial Audio </h1>
        <p>Spatial audio is an important feature in modern technology. First used in late 20th century, spatial audio is a step up from mono audio, which was originally used to output audio out of speakers placed in front of the audience. However, spatial audio setups include more speakers placed surrounding the audience, a few at the front, a few at the back, and even on the sides. This creates a 3d element to the audio, allowing more creativity for the audio in videos and games. Spatial audio is primarily featured in films and games, creating a more immersive experience. This is also used in headphones, earphones, and notably, virtual reality headsets.</p>
